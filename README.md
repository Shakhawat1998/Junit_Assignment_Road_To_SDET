# Project Title: Web Form Automation using Selenium+Juit 

### Project Summary

This project involves automating two different web forms using Selenium and JUnit for testing purposes. The automation scripts will fill out all necessary fields, handle file uploads, submit the forms, and verify that the expected confirmation messages appear after successful submissions. The objective is to streamline the web form submission process and validate the successful execution of the forms.

### Project Objectives

1. **Automate Web Form on Digital Unite**  
   - Access the web form at [Digital Unite](https://www.digitalunite.com/practice-webform-learners).
   - Automate filling out all fields on the form.
   - Upload a file (within the 2MB limit).
   - Submit the form.
   - Assert that the message "Thank you for your submission!" appears upon successful form submission.

2. **Automate Guest Registration Form**  
   - Access the guest registration form at [WP Everest](https://demo.wpeverest.com/user-registration/guest-registration-form/).
   - Automate the input of key fields: Firstname, Lastname, UserEmail, Gender, Date of Birth, Nationality, Phone, and Country (set to Bangladesh).
   - Agree to the terms and conditions.
   - Submit the form.
   - Assert that the registration is successful with a confirmation message.

### Tools and Technologies
- **Selenium**: For automating browser interactions.
- **JUnit**: To handle assertions and test automation.
- **WebDriver**: For interacting with the browser and the web forms.

This project will enhance testing efficiency by automating repetitive tasks and ensuring consistent form submissions.
